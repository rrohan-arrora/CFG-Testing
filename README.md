# Control-Flow-Graphs-Software-Testing

## Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze a Number Theory functionalities-based Java source code and perform Control Flow Graph testing on it. We have executed edge coverage and prime path coverage on various special numbers in the domain of number theory.

## Code Description
We have written a program demonstrating the workings of various special numbers such as the Markov Number, Aliquot Sequence, and Ramanujan Number. The functionalities displayed in this project has application in numerous domains ranging from cryptography to graphics.

## Testing Strategy
Control Flow Graph (CFG) testing is an approach that comes under white box testing. This technique determines the order of execution of statements in the program, i.e., how control flows in the graph. CFG offers a graphical representation of this control flow during the program execution. We have performed edge and prime path coverage on the CFGs for the application functionalities.

Our source code consists of decision statements, nested loops as well as a combination of both to thoroughly illustrate the usage of prime paths and explore all possible pathways over the nested loops and decision statements.

We have done tests on the designed test cases using JUnit. JUnit is a testing framework for Java and is used for unit testing.

We have also utilized a code coverage library named JaCoCo (Java Code Coverage) to check the percentage of line coverage achieved using our test cases.
