# Control-Flow-Graphs-Software-Testing

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to analyze a Java source code that focuses on Number Theory functionalities. Specifically, the code explores special numbers like Markov Numbers, Aliquot Sequences, and Ramanujan Numbers. These special numbers have applications in various domains, from cryptography to graphics.

## Code Description
The program demonstrates the functionality of special numbers, showcasing their significance. It includes implementations related to Markov Numbers, Aliquot Sequences, and Ramanujan Numbers.

## Testing Strategy
Control Flow Graph (CFG) testing is employed as part of white box testing. This technique visualizes the order of statement execution in the program, representing how control flows during execution. The testing specifically includes edge and prime path coverage on CFGs for the application's functionalities.

The source code comprises decision statements, nested loops, and combinations of both to thoroughly illustrate the usage of prime paths. The goal is to explore all possible pathways, especially within nested loops and decision statements.

JUnit is used for testing the designed test cases. JUnit is a testing framework for Java, commonly used for unit testing.

JaCoCo (Java Code Coverage) is utilized as a code coverage library. It helps measure the percentage of line coverage achieved by our test cases, ensuring comprehensive testing of the codebase.
